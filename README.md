# Qiskit-Hackathon-QIP
We are a mixed team of students (2 undergraduate and 1 graduate) and 2 postdocs taking part in the IBM Summer Jam Qiskit Hackathon hosted in UCD Dublin. In our project we looked at quantum image processing with Qiskit. In particular, we developed an efficient method to watermark and scrambling quantum images such that they are protected from hackers. For future work we plan to look at lattice images and pictures of magnetic structures that we use for our research in physics. 

The presentation with the explanation of our method for quantum watermarking and some results can be found in the file: Quantum_watermarking_Qiskit_Hackathon_presentation.pdf

And we provided a Jupyter notebook with our codes and examples to show how it works in practise in the file: Quantum Watermarking Greyscale Images.ipynb

For questions and recommendations you can contact us at any time.
