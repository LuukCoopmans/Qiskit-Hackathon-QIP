Here we have Monte Carlo snapshots of classical xy model
defined on 256x256 lattice. In order to get a rich vortex
struction one need larger lattice. But this can be safely
scaled down to 64x64.

There are two sets of figures, one plots the angle of the
spins and grayscale images. In the other set, the one
uses the spins themselve (cos(theta), sin(theta), 0)
as pixel colors.
