This contains STEM images, saved in form of numpy format.
These samples were given by Laura Gambini in our group.
Load them using

```python
cimg = np.load('img.npy')
nimg = np.load('noisy_img.npy')
print(cimg.shape, nimg.shape)
```

cimg, nimg are both numpy arrays of 5x128x128 shape
with 5 samples of 128x128 grayscale images.
