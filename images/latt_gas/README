The images here are directly saved from data, i.e., without any smoothing/processing.
This allows minimal size pngs with exact data from calculations.
The images range from 0.png...to 99.png are snapshots of lattice
gas model from high to low temperature. We used Monte Carlo
to simulate 'quenching' rather than slow annealing, in which
the ground state a some defects rather than perfect checkerboard
order.
